1. What is the importance of Project Structures in Game design and development? Discuss the advantages and features of using Git.
The importance of project structure in game design and development is to ensure that the project runs as smoothly as possible, keep on track, and be able to fix issues as they arise.  
The advantages of using Git is that it is the most powerful version of VCS currently used in the industry.  It allows you to work remotely, share code without jeopardizing the integrity of the master, can maintain previous working versions of the master, keep track of all the changes, undo changes, redo changes, and hold accountability to developers when working on code because everything is commented and timestamped.
